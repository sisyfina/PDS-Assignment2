FOR THE MAIN EXECUTABLE:

./main [first file] [second file] [k]

FOR THE DISTRMAIN EXECUTABLE

mpirun -np 2(or 4 or 8) distrmain [file name] [k]

but there is a problem with MPI_Gatherv() in the V1 implementation and the program although iÏ„ compiles, as long as the execution of the program reaches that point it doesn't respond.
